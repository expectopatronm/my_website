## Master of Science, Computer Engineering
### University of Paderborn
Focus areas: Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Embedded Systems

Master’s Thesis: Incremental Machine Learning using Support Vector Machines
* Designed an embedded machine learning system with Support Vector Machines for tackling Classification and Regression problems on Big Data with accuracies from 82% to 96%
* Implemented various incremental learning methods for batch and online training with approximations to reduce run time (-65%), memory (-25%) & computational complexity (-15%)
* Implemented PCA, t-SNE and Parallel Coordinate plots for visualizing high dimensional data
and K-Means and Nearest Neighbor clustering methods as a test of classifiability
* Accelerated training and inference phases by 500% using reconfigurable hardware

[Python] [C/C++] [Verilog] [Scikit-Learn]

Master’s Project: Autonomous Driving on Reconfigurable Hardware
* Designed a 1:10 scale self-driving car that can navigate using Computer Vision, aided by sensor fusion of LIDAR and Sonar for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
* System implemented on reconfigurable hardware to emulate over the air firmware updates and designed strategies for protection against external software and hardware attacks

[Python] [C/C++] [Verilog] [OpenCV]
